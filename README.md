# ArduinoTimer
Based in Mishaux original code

Just updated the code to reflect the new libraries, working on IDE 1.8.7 (September 2018)

An infinitely variable interval timer built around an Arduino

I'm working on grafting some fruit tree saplings, and I needed to be able to provide a cool mist for them at adjustable intervals as they grew. I found timers that could do this over the range of intervals I would need but they were prohibitivly expensive, so I built my own for about $40. It even has a handy lighted LCD display to let you know what it is up to.
